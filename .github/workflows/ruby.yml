    # Version Spec of the version to use. Examples: 12.x, 10.15.1, >=10.15.0.
    node-version: # optional
    # File containing the version Spec of the version to use.  Examples: package.json, .nvmrc, .node-version, .tool-versions.
    node-version-file: # optional
    # Target architecture for Node to use. Examples: x86, x64. Will use system architecture by default.
    architecture: # optional
    # Set this option if you want the action to check for the latest available version that satisfies the version spec.
    check-latest: # optional
    # Optional registry to set up for auth. Will set the registry in a project level .npmrc and .yarnrc file, and set up auth to read in from env.NODE_AUTH_TOKEN.
    registry-url: # optional
    # Optional scope for authenticating against scoped registries. Will fall back to the repository owner when using the GitHub Packages registry (https://npm.pkg.github.com/).
    scope: # optional
    # Used to pull node distributions from node-versions. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting.
    token: # optional, default is ${{ github.server_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token || '' }}
    # Used to specify a package manager for caching in the default directory. Supported values: npm, yarn, pnpm.
    cache: # optional
    # Used to specify the path to a dependency file: package-lock.json, yarn.lock, etc. Supports wildcards or a list of file names for caching multiple dependencies.
